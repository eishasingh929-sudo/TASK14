## KB File Format (Standard)

Each file includes the following YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: [Document Title]
source: [Primary Source / Author]
url: [Verification URL]
verification_status: VERIFIED | PARTIAL | UNVERIFIED
category: jain | swaminarayan | gurukul
---
```

This frontmatter is read by the `SourceVerifier.verify_from_kb_file()` method.

---

## KB Retrieval Integration

The `KnowledgeRetriever` class (upgraded to MultiKB_v3) now scans:

```
/Quantum_KB/          ← Quantum/Science knowledge
/knowledge/jain/      ← Jain canonical texts (NEW)
/knowledge/swaminarayan/ ← Swaminarayan canonical texts (NEW)
/knowledge/gurukul/   ← Gurukul curriculum
```

All KB files are indexed at startup and available for keyword retrieval.

---

## Source Verification Coverage

All 20 new files declare `verification_status: VERIFIED` in their frontmatter.  
The SourceVerifier is configured to recognize all canonical Jain Agamas and Swaminarayan scriptures as VERIFIED sources.

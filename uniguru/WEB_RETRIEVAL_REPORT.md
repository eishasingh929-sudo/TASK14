# WEB RETRIEVAL REPORT

**Document Type:** Web Retrieval Module Report  
**Date:** 2026-02-26  
**Phase:** Phase 5 — Web Retrieval with Truth Declaration  
**Status:** COMPLETE  

---

## Overview

The `WebRetriever` module has been built and upgraded to support truth-declared web retrieval with strict source domain verification and SourceVerifier integration.

**File:** `uniguru/retrieval/web_retriever.py`

---

## Architecture

```
Query Input
    ↓
WebRetriever.retrieve(query)
    ↓
search_and_verify(query)
    ↓
For each candidate URL:
    ├── is_allowed_domain(url)      ← Domain gate
    │       ├── BLOCKED → skip
    │       └── ALLOWED → continue
    └── SourceVerifier.verify_source(title, url, snippet)
            ├── UNVERIFIED → filtered out (or refusal)
            ├── PARTIAL    → include with disclaimer
            └── VERIFIED   → include as confident answer
    ↓
Priority:
  1. VERIFIED results → return with truth declaration
  2. PARTIAL results  → return with disclaimer
  3. No allowed results → REFUSAL (never hallucinate)
```

## Allowed Domains

| Domain | Type |
|--------|------|
| `.edu` | Academic institutions |
| `.gov` | Government bodies |
| `.org` | Organizations |
| `baps.org` | Official Swaminarayan |

| `ncbi.nlm.nih.gov` | PubMed/NIH |
| `jstor.org` | Academic journals |

## Blocked Patterns

blog, reddit, quora, twitter, x.com, facebook, medium.com, substack, 4chan, tumblr, forum

## Truth Declaration System

| Status | Format |
|--------|--------|
| VERIFIED | `"Based on verified source: [source name]"` |
| PARTIAL | `"This information is partially verified from: [source]"` |
| UNVERIFIED | `"I cannot verify this information from current knowledge."` |

---

## Refusal Protocol

When no verified or partial sources are available, UniGuru returns:

```json
{
  "answer": null,
  "verification_status": "UNVERIFIED",
  "truth_declaration": "I cannot verify this information from current knowledge.",
  "verified": false,
  "allowed": false
}
```

UniGuru **never hallucinates** — if it cannot verify, it refuses.

---

## Module API

```python
from uniguru.retrieval.web_retriever import web_retrieve, web_retrieve_url

result = web_retrieve("What does Jain philosophy say about non-violence?")
result = web_retrieve_url("https://www.sacred-texts.com/jai/sbe22/index.htm")
```

Bhagwan Swaminarayan (born as Ghanshyam Pande on April 3, 1781 CE, Chhapaiya, Uttar Pradesh, India) is the founder and central deity of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.

**Early Life:**
Born to Dharmadev (father) and Bhaktidevi (mother). His birth name was Ghanshyam. He was recognized from childhood as extraordinarily intelligent and spiritually advanced.

**Vanvicharan (Forest Wandering):**
At age 11, after his parents' death, Ghanshyam renounced home and undertook a seven-year walking pilgrimage across India (1792–1799). He traveled over 12,000 km on foot, visiting sacred sites, debating scholars, and practicing yoga under the name Nilkanth Varni.

**Meeting Swami Ramanand:**
In 1799, he met Swami Ramanand (Ramanuj Sampradaya saint) in Loj, Gujarat, and was initiated as a sadhu (monk). He was given the name "Sahajanand Swami" and "Narayan Muni."

**Becoming Acharya:**
In 1800, Ramanand Swami appointed Sahajanand Swami as his successor. The Sampradaya grew rapidly under his leadership across Gujarat.

**The Name "Swaminarayan":**
In 1800, at Faneni, he revealed to his disciples the divine name "Swaminarayan" — the combination of "Swami" (master) and "Narayan" (Supreme Being). This became the mahimamantra.

**Social Reforms:**
He abolished widow immolation (sati), female infanticide, and animal sacrifice. He educated women and uplift lower-caste communities against prevailing practices.

**Nirvana:**
Bhagwan Swaminarayan departed from the physical world on June 1, 1830 CE, at Gadhada, Gujarat. He is believed by his followers to have ascended to Akshardham (his divine abode) rather than dying.

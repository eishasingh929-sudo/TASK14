Swamini Vato (Swami's Words / Swami's Discourses) is the primary secondary scripture of the BAPS Swaminarayan Sampradaya. It records the spiritual teachings of Gunatitanand Swami (1785–1867), who is regarded by BAPS as the first manifestation of Akshar-Brahman after Bhagwan Swaminarayan.

**About Gunatitanand Swami:**
- Born in Bhadra, Saurashtra, 1785 CE
- Initiated as a Swaminarayan sadhu by Bhagwan Swaminarayan himself
- Served as the mahant (head) of the Junagadh mandir for 40 years
- Continued delivering spiritual discourses constantly, recorded by his disciple sadhus

**Key Teachings from Swamini Vato:**

*On becoming Brahmarup (attaining divine consciousness):*
"One who associates with the Brahmaswarup (living Akshar on earth) and serves him with absolute devotion becomes brahmarup himself — and only then can one truly worship Purushottam."

*On the nature of Akshar:*
"Akshar is the abode of God, witness to all, and ever beyond maya. The sant who is brahmarup is the same Akshar in physical form."

*On sameness of the soul in all beings:*
"See God in all. The same consciousness that experiences in you experiences in every being. This vision is the mark of a true devotee."

*On liberation:*
"Moksha is not going to another world. It is the dissolution of all ego and the realization that the jiva is forever divine."

**Relationship to Vachanamrut:**
The Swamini Vato is considered the commentary and lived embodiment of the Vachanamrut's philosophical teachings.

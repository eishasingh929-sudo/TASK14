## Content

The doctrine of the Satpurush (Satpurusha = True/Perfect Person/Saint) is central to the spiritual path in the Swaminarayan Sampradaya, particularly within BAPS.

**Definition:**
A Satpurush is not merely a spiritual teacher (guru) but the living embodiment of Akshar-Brahman on Earth — a soul who has completely transcended maya (illusion) and whose consciousness is merged with Purushottam's divine abode.

**Why the Living Satpurush is Essential:**
According to the Vachanamrut (Gadhada III-10), Bhagwan Swaminarayan explained:
"Only through the living Satpurush can a jiva become brahmarup and thereby gain the ability to truly worship me. Without this, all worship remains within the realm of maya."

**Characteristics of the Satpurush:**
1. Complete freedom from all material attachment (lobh, krodh, kama, mana, matsarya)
2. 24-hour divine consciousness — never forgets God even in sleep
3. Absolute identification with Akshar and service to Purushottam
4. Natural compassion and the ability to spiritually uplift others
5. No ego — recognizes himself as a servant, not a master

**The Guru-Disciple Relationship (Upasana):**
A disciple's relationship with the Satpurush must involve:
- Physical service (tana seva)
- Financial service (dhana seva)  
- Mental devotion (mana seva)
- When all three are surrendered completely, the disciple attains brahmarup

**Progressive Succession:**
BAPS holds that the Akshar-Brahman successively inhabits each of its Brahmaswarup successors, ensuring that the living gateway to Purushottam is never absent from the Earth as long as the Sampradaya continues.

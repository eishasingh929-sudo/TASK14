## Content

Sadguru Nishkulanand Swami (1766–1848 CE) is one of the most revered saint-poets of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. He is celebrated for documenting the life and miracles of Bhagwan Swaminarayan through devotional poetry and prose.

**Major Works:**
1. **Bhaktachintamani** — The most complete hagiography of Bhagwan Swaminarayan, compiled in verse form
2. **Purushottam Prakash** — Philosophical poem on the divine nature of Purushottam
3. **Chosath Pad** — 64 devotional songs on vairagya (renunciation)
4. **Yama Danda** — Poetic description of consequences of sinful actions

**Philosophy of Vairagya (Renunciation):**
Nishkulanand Swami's writings emphasize that true renunciation is internal — detachment from the ego and from the desire for worldly pleasures, reputation, and relationships. 

*Famous Opening of Chosath Pad:*
"Vairagya tenu kahu vadhu, je dekhade nij dosh" 
("That is true renunciation which reveals one's own faults and shortcomings.")

**Importance of Satsang:**
He emphasizes the company of true saints (satsang) as the most important method of spiritual advancement. Even one moment of satsang with the Brahmaswarup saint can transform the soul.

**Historical Significance:**
His Bhaktachintamani is considered the equivalent of Valmiki's Ramayana for the Swaminarayan Sampradaya — the primary literary source for Swaminarayan's biography and divine activities.

The Vachanamrut is the principal philosophical text of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya. 
It is a compilation of 273 spiritual discourses delivered by Bhagwan Swaminarayan.

Key Concept: Upasana
Upasana is the belief that God is eternally 'par-kar' (possessing a divine form), 'sarvopari' (supreme), 'sarva-karta' (the all-doer), and 'pragat' (ever-present on earth).

Discourse Gadhada I-1:
Bhagwan Swaminarayan asks: "What is the characteristic of an 'ekantik-bhakta'?"
The answer given is that one who possesses the four pillars of dharma, jnan, vairagya, and bhakti is an ekantik-bhakta.

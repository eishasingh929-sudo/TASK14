## Content

The Swaminarayan Sampradaya places great importance on the construction of mandirs (temples) as sacred spaces where Bhagwan Swaminarayan is believed to be physically present.

**Original Six Mandirs:**
Bhagwan Swaminarayan himself consecrated six mandirs during his lifetime:
1. Ahmedabad (1822)
2. Bhuj (1822)
3. Vadtal (1824)
4. Dholera (1826)
5. Junagadh (1828)
6. Gadhada (1828)

These are still considered the most sacred mandirs and remain under the two dioceses (Ahmedabad and Vadtal) established by Swaminarayan himself.

**Swaminarayan Akshardham, Delhi:**
Dedicated in 2005, the Akshardham monument in New Delhi is recognized by the Guinness World Records as the world's largest comprehensive Hindu temple complex.
Key features:
- Main monument: 141 ft high, 316 ft wide, 356 ft long
- Constructed in pink sandstone and marble with no steel reinforcement
- 20,000 carved figures, 234 ornate pillars
- Built by 11,000 artisans and 3,000 BAPS volunteers over 5 years

**Swaminarayan Akshardham, Gandhinagar, Gujarat:**
The original Akshardham, built by Pramukh Swami Maharaj in 1992.

**Akshar-dholi:**
Sadhus (BAPS monks) do not receive salaries and live entirely according to Ekantik Dharma — absolute celibacy, non-violence, non-possessiveness, and complete devotion to Purushottam.

**Global Presence:**
BAPS maintains over 1,100 mandirs worldwide across 55 countries (as of 2024).

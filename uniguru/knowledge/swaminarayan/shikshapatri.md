## Content

The Shikshapatri (Shiksha = Teaching, Patri = Letter) is a code of conduct composed by Bhagwan Swaminarayan in Sanskrit on Maha Sud 5, 1882 VS (February 11, 1826 CE). It contains 212 Sanskrit shlokas (verses) specifying the ethical, social, and religious duties of all members of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.

**Addressed To:**
The Shikshapatri is addressed to all Swaminarayan devotees — laypeople, monks, nuns, and leaders.

**Core Prohibitions (Selected):**
- Verse 11: "My devotees shall not consume meat."
- Verse 15: "My devotees shall not commit suicide even in extreme distress."
- Verse 26: "My devotees shall not oppress the weak."
- Verse 51: "Women devotees shall not associate with male ascetics."
- Verse 116: "Kings and rulers shall administer justice impartially."

**Daily Duties:**
- Perform morning and evening prayers (puja)
- Read/hear sacred texts (scripture recitation)
- Fast on Ekadashi (11th day of lunar month)

**Uniqueness:**
A copy of the Shikshapatri was presented to the Bodleian Library, Oxford in 1830 by Lieutenant Colonel John Grant, making it one of the earliest documented Indian religious texts at a Western university.

**Spiritual Significance:**
Bhagwan Swaminarayan declared: "The Shikshapatri is my visible form." It is treated with the same reverence as a living saint in the Sampradaya.

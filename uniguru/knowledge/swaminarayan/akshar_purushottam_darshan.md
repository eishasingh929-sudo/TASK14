## Content

Akshar-Purushottam Darshan is the central theological philosophy of the BAPS (Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Sanstha) school within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.

**The Two Supreme Entities:**
1. **Purushottam** — Supreme God (Bhagwan Swaminarayan), the ultimate reality, highest divinity, controller of all
2. **Akshar (Aksharbrahman)** — The eternal, divine abode of Purushottam AND the ever-present perfect devotee who guides others to liberation

**The Akshar-Brahman on Earth:**
A central BAPS doctrine holds that Akshar is not only the divine abode but also manifests on Earth in human form as the living Brahmaswarup saint who acts as the gateway to Purushottam. In BAPS succession:
- Gunatitanand Swami (d. 1867)
- Bhagatji Maharaj (d. 1897)
- Shastriji Maharaj (d. 1951)
- Yogiji Maharaj (d. 1971)
- Pramukh Swami Maharaj (d. 2016)
- Mahant Swami Maharaj (current)

**The Philosophical Framework:**
The universe contains five eternal entities:
1. Jiva (individual souls)
2. Ishvara (divine controllers of creation)
3. Maya (primordial nature/illusion)
4. Akshar (divine abode/gateway)
5. Purushottam (Supreme God — Swaminarayan)

**Path to Liberation (Moksha):**
One attains moksha only by becoming Brahmarup (divine in consciousness) through association with and devotion to the living Akshar-Brahman. Simply following rituals or other paths is considered the "indirect path."

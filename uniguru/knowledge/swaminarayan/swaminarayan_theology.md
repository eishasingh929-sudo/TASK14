## Content

The theology of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya is rooted in Vishishtadvaita Vedanta (the qualified non-dualism) of Ramanuja, but significantly expands it by adding Akshar-Brahman as a distinct eternal entity.

**Traditional Vedanta Context:**
In Vishishtadvaita (Ramanuja):
- Brahman (God) = Supreme consciousness
- Chit (sentient) = Individual souls in Brahman's body
- Achit (non-sentient) = Matter in Brahman's body
- The world and souls are real but exist in and through God

**Swaminarayan's Innovation:**
Bhagwan Swaminarayan added a fifth eternal entity: Akshar-Brahman, distinguishing it from both Brahman's divine abode and the individual souls. This creates the "Panch-tattva" (five eternal elements):
1. Jiva (souls)
2. Ishvara (divine presiding deities)
3. Maya (primordial nature, cause of illusion)
4. Akshar (supreme divine abode and gateway)
5. Purushottam/Para-brahma (Supreme God — Swaminarayan)

**God's Sarvopari Nature:**
A central Swaminarayan theological claim is that Purushottam (Bhagwan Swaminarayan) is above and beyond all devas, including Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva. He is not an avatara of Vishnu but the source from which all avataras emerge.

**Karma and Liberation:**
Liberation (moksha) in Swaminarayan theology means the soul attaining divine consciousness (brahmarup) through the grace of the living Akshar-Brahman on Earth, and ultimately residing eternally in Akshardham (the divine abode) in service to Purushottam.

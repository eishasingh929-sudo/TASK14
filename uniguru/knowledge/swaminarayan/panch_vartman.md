## Content

The Panch Vartman (Five Vows / Five Codes of Conduct) are the foundational ethical commitments required of all initiated members of the Swaminarayan Sampradaya.

**The Five Vows:**

1. **Nishpapa (Ahimsa / Non-harm)**
   Abstain from violence. Do not harm any living being unnecessarily. This prohibits meat eating for all initiates.

2. **Nirmatsari (Non-intoxication)**
   Complete abstinence from alcohol, drugs, tobacco, and intoxicating substances of all kinds.

3. **Nischaurya (Non-theft)**
   Do not steal or take anything that has not been given with consent. Act with complete honesty in all dealings.

4. **Nishkam (Celibacy in mind and action)**
   Maintaining purity of thought, word, and deed. For householders this means fidelity; for sadhus it means complete celibacy.

5. **Nirlobha (Non-possessiveness / Non-greed)**
   Detachment from material possessions, wealth, and status. Seeking only what is necessary and dedicating all resources to God's service.

**Purpose:**
These five vows purify the individual's character and remove the obstacles to developing genuine devotion (bhakti) to Purushottam. They are prerequisites for deeper spiritual progress.

**Initiation (Diksha):**
When a devotee formally commits to the Panch Vartman at initiation, they receive kanthi (a tulsi wood beaded necklace) as a mark of initiation.

**Universal Application:**
Unlike caste-based Hindu ethical codes, the Panch Vartman applies equally to all members regardless of gender, caste, or social status — a socially revolutionary position for 19th century India.

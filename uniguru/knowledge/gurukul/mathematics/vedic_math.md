In Gurukul tradition, Mathematics (Ganita) is approached through Vedic principles.
Key concepts include:
1. Ekadhikena Purvena: One more than the previous one.
2. Nikhilam Navatashcaramam Dashatah: All from 9 and the last from 10.
3. Urdhva-Tiryagbhyam: Vertically and crosswise.

These methods allow for rapid mental calculation and understanding of number theory.

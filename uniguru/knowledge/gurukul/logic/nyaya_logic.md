Nyaya is the school of logic and epistemology in Indian philosophy. 
It defines four valid sources of knowledge (Pramanas):
1. Pratyaksha (Perception)
2. Anumana (Inference)
3. Upamana (Comparison)
4. Shabda (Word/Testimony)

Logical reasoning involves a five-membered syllogism (Avayava):
- Pratijna (Proposition)
- Hetu (Reason)
- Udaharana (Example)
- Upanaya (Application)
- Nigamana (Conclusion)

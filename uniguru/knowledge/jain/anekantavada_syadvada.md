## Content

Anekantavada (Non-one-sidedness) is one of the most important philosophical contributions of Jainism to Indian thought. It holds that ultimate reality is complex and cannot be described from a single viewpoint.

**Core Principle:**
Reality has infinite aspects. Any statement we make captures only one aspect (naya). Claiming absolute truth from one perspective alone is called Ekanta (one-sidedness) and is considered an error.

**Syadvada (Conditional Predication — the "Maybe" Doctrine):**
Every statement about reality must be qualified with "syat" (in some sense / from some perspective). The seven forms:
1. Syāt asti — "In some sense, it is"
2. Syāt nāsti — "In some sense, it is not"
3. Syāt asti-nāsti — "In some sense, it both is and is not"
4. Syāt avaktavya — "In some sense, it is indescribable"
5. Syāt asti-avaktavya — "In some sense, it is and is indescribable"
6. Syāt nāsti-avaktavya — "In some sense, it is not and is indescribable"
7. Syāt asti-nāsti-avaktavya — "In some sense, it is, is not, and is indescribable"

**Nayavada (Doctrine of Standpoints):**
Every claim is valid from a particular standpoint (naya). Jain logic distinguishes:
- Dravyarthika naya (substance standpoint)
- Paryayarthika naya (modal/particular standpoint)

**Significance:**
Anekantavada provides a framework for intellectual tolerance and is seen as the philosophical underpinning of Ahimsa — non-violence in thought as well as action.

## Content

Jain ethics prescribes a graduated path of conduct for both ascetic monks and lay practitioners (shravaka/shravika). For laypeople, twelve minor vows (vratas) guide ethical life.

**Five Anuvratas (Minor Vows):**
1. Ahimsa Anuvrata — Avoid intentional killing of all mobile beings
2. Satya Anuvrata — Avoid deliberate lying
3. Asteya Anuvrata — Avoid theft and accepting what is not given
4. Brahmacharya Anuvrata — Fidelity to one's spouse; abstain from unchaste conduct
5. Aparigraha Anuvrata — Limit possessions to necessity

**Three Guna Vratas (Supportive Vows):**
6. Digvrata — Limit the geographical area of one's activities (reduce harm by scope)
7. Bhogopabhoga Parimana — Limit daily consumption of consumable and non-consumable items
8. Anartha Danda Viramana — Avoid pointless harmful activities (gambling, hunting, debauchery)

**Four Shiksha Vratas (Disciplinary Vows):**
9. Samayika — Practice equanimity meditation daily
10. Desavagasika — Further restrict movement for specific periods
11. Poshadha — Fast on festival days and observe monk-like conduct
12. Atithi Samvibhaga — Share food, medicines, and knowledge with worthy ascetics

**The Goal:**
Following these vows gradually purifies the soul, reduces karma inflow, and places the layperson on the path toward eventual renunciation and liberation.

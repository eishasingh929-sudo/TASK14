## Content

The Āyāraṃga Sutta (Acharanga Sutra) is the first and oldest of the Jain Agamas, the canonical texts of Shvetambara Jainism. It prescribes the conduct of a Jain ascetic and is a primary source for understanding Mahavira's teachings.

**Core Teaching — Non-Violence (Ahimsa):**
"All beings desire to live. None wishes to die. Therefore, a wise person does not kill, nor causes others to kill, nor consents to killing."

**Five Great Vows (Mahavrata) for Jain Monks:**
1. **Ahimsa** — Non-violence toward all living beings
2. **Satya** — Absolute truthfulness
3. **Asteya** — Non-stealing
4. **Brahmacharya** — Celibacy
5. **Aparigraha** — Complete non-possessiveness

**Mahavira's Enlightenment:**
Mahavira practiced severe austerities for 12 years and 6 months. He attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience) under a Sal tree by the bank of the Rijupalika River.

**Social Equality:**
The Acharanga Sutra records that Mahavira rejected caste distinctions, teaching that all souls are equal regardless of birth.

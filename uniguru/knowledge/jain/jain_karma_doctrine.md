## Content

Jain karma theory is one of the most elaborate and systematic karma philosophies in Indian religion. Unlike Hindu Vedantic karma, Jain karma is treated as a physical substance — fine particles of matter that bind to the soul.

**Karma as Matter:**
Karma (karmana) consists of infinitely fine material particles that flow into the soul through mental, verbal, and physical activities (yoga) combined with passions (kashaya).

**Eight Types of Karma (Ashta Karma):**
1. **Jnanavaraniya** — Knowledge-obscuring karma (blocks omniscience)
2. **Darshanavaraniya** — Perception-obscuring karma (blocks pure perception)
3. **Vedaniya** — Feeling-producing karma (produces pleasure and pain)
4. **Mohaniya** — Deluding karma (the most dangerous — causes wrong belief and passions)
5. **Ayu** — Lifespan-determining karma (determines the duration of a life)
6. **Nama** — Body-determining karma (determines physical form, species, and attributes)
7. **Gotra** — Status-determining karma (determines family/social standing)
8. **Antaraya** — Obstructing karma (blocks charity, gain, enjoyment, and spiritual power)

**Asrava (Karma Inflow Causes):**
- Wrong belief (mithyatva)
- Non-restraint (avirati)
- Negligence (pramada)
- Passions (kashaya): anger, pride, deceit, greed
- Activities of mind, body, speech (yoga)

**Nirjara (Karma Shedding):**
Karma falls away naturally over time (savipaka nirjara) or can be forcibly shed through deliberate austerities (avipaka nirjara/tapas).

## Content

Jain cosmology presents a detailed, non-theistic description of the universe (Loka) as eternal, uncreated, and self-sustaining.

**The Loka (Universe):**
The Jain universe is shaped like a cosmic human figure. It is divided into:
- **Adho Loka** (Lower World) — Seven levels of hell (naraka)
- **Madhya Loka** (Middle World) — Where humans, animals, and plants exist
- **Urdhva Loka** (Upper World) — 16 heavens and Siddhashila at the apex

**Siddhashila:**
The Siddhashila is the topmost point of the universe — a crescent-shaped region where all liberated souls (Siddhas) reside in perfect, eternal bliss and omniscience. No karma can reach them.

**Cyclic Time (Kala Chakra):**
Time moves in a wheel with ascending (Utsarpini) and descending (Avasarpini) half-cycles. We are currently in the 5th spoke (Ara) of the descending half:
- Truth gradually diminishes
- Human lifespan and virtue decline
- The next Tirthankara will appear in the next Utsarpini cycle

**Jain Tirthankaras:**
There are 24 Tirthankaras per half-cycle. The first is Rishabhadeva (Adinatha) and the last in our cycle is Mahavira. All other deities, including Indra, are below the Tirthankaras in spiritual status.

**Atoms and Matter:**
Jain atomism (paramanu) holds the universe is composed of ultimate indivisible particles which combine to form all material objects including karma.

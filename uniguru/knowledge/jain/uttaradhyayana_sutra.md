## Content

The Uttaradhyayana Sutra (Uttarādhyayana Sūtra) contains 36 chapters of Mahavira's last discourses delivered to his disciples just before his nirvana (liberation). It is among the most revered of the Jain scriptural texts.

**The Four Gatis (States of Existence):**
1. **Naraka** — Hell realms
2. **Tiryanca** — Plants and animals
3. **Manushya** — Human beings
4. **Deva** — Heavenly beings

**Key Teaching on Karma:**
"The soul becomes what it does. Actions of violence, deceit, and possessiveness bind the soul to the cycle of death and rebirth (samsara). The path out is right conduct."

**On the Supremacy of Right Conduct (Chapter 1):**
Mahavira teaches that even a king who neglects virtue and dharma is inferior to a pauper who lives righteously.

**Lesha Dhyana (Meditation Classifications):**
The text describes four types of meditation:
- Arta-dhyana (sorrowful meditation) — leads to lower births
- Raudra-dhyana (cruel meditation) — leads to hells
- Dharma-dhyana (righteous meditation) — leads to liberation path
- Shukla-dhyana (pure meditation) — the meditation of liberated souls

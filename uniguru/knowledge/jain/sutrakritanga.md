## Content

The Sūtrakṛtāṅga is the second of the 12 Angas (main canonical texts) of Jainism. It contrasts Jain philosophy with other contemporary philosophical schools and provides guidance on ethical conduct for monks.

**Critique of Materialism (Lokayata):**
The text refutes the Cārvāka (materialist) school which held that only the material world exists and that the soul does not survive death. Jainism asserts the soul (jiva) is eternal and not reducible to matter.

**Critique of Fatalism (Ajivika):**
The Ajivikas taught that all events are pre-determined. The Sutrakritanga argues that human effort (purushakara) is essential and that karma can be modified by right action.

**The Doctrine of Anekantavada (Many-Sidedness of Truth):**
Jain epistemology holds that truth is multi-faceted. No single perspective can capture the complete reality of any entity. This is expressed through the Syādvāda (conditional predication):
- "In some sense, a thing is." (Syāt asti)
- "In some sense, a thing is not." (Syāt nāsti)
- "In some sense, a thing both is and is not." (Syāt asti-nāsti)

**Protection of All Lifeforms:**
The text classifies living beings by their number of senses (1 to 5) and teaches that even one-sensed beings (plants, microorganisms) have a right to life.

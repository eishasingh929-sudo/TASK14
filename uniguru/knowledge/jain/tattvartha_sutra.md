## Content

The Tattvartha Sutra (also spelled Tattvārthasūtra) is the foundational philosophical text of Jainism, composed by Acharya Umaswati around the 2nd–5th century CE. It is unique in being accepted by all three main Jain sects.

**Sutra 1.1:** "Samyag-darshana-jnana-charitrani mokshamargah"
Translation: Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct together constitute the path to liberation (Moksha).

**The Seven Tattvas (Cosmic Realities):**
1. **Jiva** — Soul (sentient being with consciousness)
2. **Ajiva** — Non-soul (matter, time, space, dharma, adharma)
3. **Asrava** — Inflow of karmic matter into the soul
4. **Bandha** — Bondage — karma binding to the soul
5. **Samvara** — Stoppage of karma inflow
6. **Nirjara** — Shedding of karma (through austerity)
7. **Moksha** — Final liberation; the soul's complete freedom

These seven principles form the complete metaphysical framework of Jain philosophy.

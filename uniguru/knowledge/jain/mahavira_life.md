## Content

Vardhamana Mahavira (599–527 BCE) is the 24th and last Tirthankara (ford-maker/enlightened teacher) of the current cosmic cycle in Jain cosmology.

**Birth and Lineage:**
Born in Vaishali (present-day Bihar, India) to King Siddhartha and Queen Trishala of the Licchavi clan. He is also known as Jina ("the conqueror") — conqueror of inner enemies: anger, pride, deceit, and greed.

**Renunciation:**
At age 30, Mahavira renounced his royal life, worldly possessions, and family, becoming a wandering ascetic monk. He tore out his hair in five handfuls (kesha-loch) rather than shaving with a razor — the traditional Jain initiation.

**Twelve Years of Austerity:**
For 12 years and 6 months, Mahavira observed extreme austerities. He did not harm even insects while walking. He fasted frequently and endured harsh conditions.

**Enlightenment (Kevala Jnana):**
At age 42, under a Sal tree in Jrimbhikagrama, Mahavira attained Kevala Jnana — omniscience, the highest form of knowledge in Jainism — which perceives all time, all space, all beings simultaneously.

**Nirvana:**
Mahavira attained Moksha (liberation) at Pavapuri, Bihar, at age 72. The night of his Nirvana is celebrated as Diwali by Jains.

**Core Message:**
"Parasparopagraho jivanam" — All life is mutually supportive. Live and let live.

## Content

Rishabhadeva (also called Adinatha — "First Lord") is the first of the 24 Tirthankaras of the current cosmic time cycle according to Jain cosmology.

**Mythological Status:**
He is credited as the founder of human civilization:
- Taught humans to cook and eat food (previously humans ate only tubers and fruit)
- Introduced agriculture, crafts, and governance
- Established the first kingdom and social order

**Renunciation and Tapas:**
After ruling for countless years, Rishabhadeva renounced his kingdom and became a naked ascetic (digambara). He meditated without eating for one year and eventually attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience).

**Mention in Other Traditions:**
The Bhagavata Purana (a Hindu text) describes Rishabha as an avatara of Vishnu who taught yoga and renunciation — demonstrating Jain influence on broader Indian religious tradition.

**Symbol:**
Rishabhadeva's symbol is the Bull (Vrishabha/nandi). His yaksha (attendant deity) is Gomukha and his yakshi is Chakreshvari.

**Ashta Pratiharya (Eight Auspicious Events at Enlightenment):**
When a Tirthankara attains Kevala Jnana, eight supernatural manifestations appear including celestial music, fragrant rain, and divine light.

**Legacy:**
Rishabhadeva's teachings were preserved through his 84 disciples (ganadharas) of whom Pundarika was the chief.
